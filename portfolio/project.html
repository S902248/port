                <p>Description:
                    Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink that was created by John Stith Pemberton in the late 19th century. It was first introduced in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and has since become one of the most iconic and popular beverages worldwide. The original Coca-Cola formula is a closely guarded trade secret.
                    
                    The beverage is characterized by its unique sweet and fizzy taste, created by a blend of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup or sucrose, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural flavors, and caffeine (in some versions). Coca-Cola is typically served chilled and is available in various sizes, including cans, bottles, and fountain drinks.
                    
                    Over the years, Coca-Cola has expanded its product line to include a variety of beverages, such as Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, and a range of flavored and non-carbonated options. The brand is not only known for its products but also for its distinctive red and white logo and memorable advertising campaigns.
                    
                    Coca-Cola has established itself as a symbol of refreshment, happiness, and global unity, with a presence in virtually every corner of the world. The company has also been involved in various sponsorships, community initiatives, and partnerships throughout its long history.</p>
